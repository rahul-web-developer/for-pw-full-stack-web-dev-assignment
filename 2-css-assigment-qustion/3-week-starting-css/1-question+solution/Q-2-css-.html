    Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML. It allows web designers to control the appearance and layout of multiple web pages at once. With CSS, you can define colors, fonts, margins, padding, and many other visual properties of HTML elements.
