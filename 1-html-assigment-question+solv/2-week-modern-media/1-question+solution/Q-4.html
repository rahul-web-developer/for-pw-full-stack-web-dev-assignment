    <!-- List any 3 ways which help us in improving the accessibility of HTML-->

   <pre> Improving the accessibility of HTML is essential for ensuring that websites and web applications are usable by all individuals, including those with disabilities. Here are three ways to enhance accessibility:

    Semantic HTML: Using semantic HTML tags appropriately helps improve accessibility. Semantic tags, such as <header>, <nav>, <main>, <article>, <section>, <aside>, <figure>, and <figcaption>, provide meaning and structure to the content. They allow assistive technologies like screen readers to interpret and navigate the page more accurately. By utilizing these tags correctly, you make it easier for all users, including those with disabilities, to understand the content and navigate through it.

    Alt Text for Images: Providing alternative text (alt text) for images is crucial for users who are visually impaired or have assistive technologies that cannot interpret images. Alt text should concisely describe the purpose or content of the image. By including descriptive alt text, you enable screen readers to convey the information to users who can't see the image. This makes the content more accessible and inclusive.

    Keyboard Accessibility: Ensuring that all interactive elements on a webpage are accessible via keyboard navigation is vital for individuals who cannot use a mouse or have motor disabilities. You can achieve keyboard accessibility by using appropriate HTML tags like <button>, <a>, and <input> for interactive elements. Additionally, providing focus styles and managing focus order correctly helps users understand which element is currently active or in focus, making it easier to navigate and interact with the content using only the keyboard.

These are just a few examples of techniques to improve accessibility in HTML. It's important to adopt a holistic approach to accessibility and follow best practices and guidelines provided by organizations like the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) to ensure your web content is accessible to as many users as possible.
