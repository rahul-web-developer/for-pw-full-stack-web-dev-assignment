    <!--What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our webpage.-->

    <br>
    <pre>    Improved Accessibility: Semantic tags provide meaning and structure to the content, making it easier for assistive technologies like screen readers to understand and navigate the webpage. This enhances accessibility for people with disabilities, ensuring they can access and comprehend the information effectively.

        Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Search engines rely on understanding the structure and context of webpages to deliver relevant search results. By using semantic tags, you can help search engines interpret your content more accurately, potentially improving your website's visibility and ranking in search engine results pages.
    
        Code Readability and Maintainability: Semantic tags promote clean and organized code structure. They provide clear and meaningful descriptions of the content they enclose, making it easier for developers to understand and maintain the webpage's codebase. Semantic markup also helps other developers who may work on the project in the future, leading to improved collaboration and code consistency.
    
        Future Compatibility and Adaptability: Semantic tags adhere to standardized HTML5 conventions, ensuring compatibility with present and future web technologies. As new devices and platforms emerge, semantic markup helps ensure that your webpage remains accessible and well-structured across different contexts, such as mobile devices, voice assistants, and emerging technologies.
    
        Enhances User Experience: Semantic tags contribute to a better user experience by providing visual cues and structure. When properly used, they help users understand the content hierarchy and relationships between different sections of the webpage. This improves readability, comprehension, and overall user satisfaction.
    
        CSS Styling and Design Flexibility: Semantic tags often have default styling associated with them, allowing browsers and CSS frameworks to provide basic styles for certain elements. By using semantic tags, you can take advantage of these default styles while maintaining the flexibility to customize and enhance the design according to your specific requirements.
    
    In summary, using semantic tags in webpages offers benefits such as improved accessibility, better search engine optimization, enhanced code readability and maintainability, future compatibility, improved user experience, and CSS styling advantages.
