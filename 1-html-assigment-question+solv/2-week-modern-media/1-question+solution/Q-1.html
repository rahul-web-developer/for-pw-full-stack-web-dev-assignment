    <!-- List out the features of HTML5E-->
   <pre> HTML5, the latest version of the Hypertext Markup Language, introduced several new features and improvements compared to its predecessor, HTML4. Some of the key features of HTML5 are:

    Semantic elements: HTML5 introduced a set of new semantic elements such as header, footer, nav, article, section, aside, etc. These elements provide a clearer structure to web documents, making it easier for search engines and assistive technologies to understand the content.

    Audio and video support: HTML5 includes native support for embedding audio and video content without the need for third-party plugins like Flash. The audio and video elements allow developers to easily add multimedia elements to their web pages.

    Canvas: The canvas element in HTML5 provides a drawing API that allows developers to dynamically create and manipulate graphics, animations, and visualizations using JavaScript.

    Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG): HTML5 introduced native support for SVG, which is an XML-based vector graphics format. SVG allows developers to create and manipulate scalable and interactive graphics directly within the HTML document.

    Geolocation: HTML5 enables web applications to retrieve the geographic location of a user with the user's consent. This feature is helpful for location-based services, mapping applications, and other location-aware web applications.

    Local storage: HTML5 introduced the localStorage and sessionStorage APIs, which allow web applications to store data locally on the client-side. This enables the persistence of data between sessions and reduces the reliance on server-side storage.

    Offline web applications: HTML5 includes technologies such as the Application Cache and Service Workers, which enable web applications to work offline or in low-connectivity situations. The application cache allows developers to specify which resources should be cached for offline use, while Service Workers enable more advanced offline capabilities and background synchronization.

    WebSockets: HTML5 introduced the WebSocket API, which provides full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. WebSockets enable real-time communication between a web browser and a server, allowing for interactive and responsive web applications.

    Drag and Drop: HTML5 added support for drag-and-drop interactions within web applications. Developers can use the Drag and Drop API to implement intuitive and interactive user interfaces that allow users to drag elements and drop them onto target areas.

    Form enhancements: HTML5 introduced several new input types, attributes, and form validation capabilities, making it easier for developers to create user-friendly and accessible forms. Some of the new input types include email, number, date, range, color, etc.

These are just a few of the many features introduced in HTML5. The adoption of HTML5 has revolutionized web development, enabling richer multimedia experiences, improved interactivity, and better performance across different devices and platforms.
