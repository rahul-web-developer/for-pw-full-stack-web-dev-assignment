    <!--E What are HTML Entities? List out 5 commonly used HTML entities-->
   <pre> HTML entities are special character codes used in HTML to display characters that are reserved or have special meaning in HTML. They are represented by an ampersand (&) followed by a unique entity name or a numerical code, and end with a semicolon (;). Here are five commonly used HTML entities:

    < (less than): Represents the less than symbol (<). It is used to display the less than sign without triggering the interpretation of an opening HTML tag.
    Example: <p>This is &lt;strong&gt;important&lt;/strong&gt;</p>

    > (greater than): Represents the greater than symbol (>). It is used to display the greater than sign without triggering the interpretation of a closing HTML tag.
    Example: <p>2 &gt; 1</p>

    & (ampersand): Represents the ampersand symbol (&). It is used to display the ampersand without starting an entity or character reference.
    Example: <p>This &amp; that</p>

    " (quotation mark): Represents the quotation mark ("). It is used to display double quotation marks within a string.
    Example: <p>"Hello, world!"</p>

    © (copyright): Represents the copyright symbol (©). It is used to display the copyright symbol.
    Example: <p>&copy; 2023 My Company</p>

These entities help ensure that special characters are displayed correctly in HTML, regardless of their reserved or special meaning.
