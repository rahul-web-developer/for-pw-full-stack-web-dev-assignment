    <!--E Write a short note on the tab index-->

    <pre>The tabindex attribute is used in HTML to specify the order in which elements are focused when navigating through a web page using the keyboard. It allows developers to control the flow of keyboard focus and ensure that users can navigate a webpage in a logical and accessible manner.

        By default, elements on a webpage are navigated in the order they appear in the HTML source code. However, this order may not always be intuitive or logical from a user's perspective. The tabindex attribute provides a solution by allowing developers to assign a specific tab order to elements.
        
        The tabindex attribute can be applied to interactive elements such as links, buttons, form fields, and even custom interactive elements using JavaScript. It takes a numerical value as its argument, where a value of "0" makes an element focusable in the default order, and a positive value greater than "0" specifies a custom tab order. Elements with a lower tabindex value are focused first, followed by elements with higher tabindex values.
        
        It's important to note that using tabindex to modify the natural tab order can potentially create a confusing or frustrating user experience. It should be used judiciously and with consideration for accessibility guidelines. In general, it is recommended to follow the natural flow of the document and ensure that keyboard focus is logical and predictable for users.
        
        In summary, the tabindex attribute is a useful tool for developers to control the keyboard focus order on a webpage. It helps improve accessibility and usability for users who rely on keyboard navigation, allowing them to navigate through interactive elements in a more structured and intuitive manner.
