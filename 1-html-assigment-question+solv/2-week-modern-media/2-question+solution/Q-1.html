        Controversies
        Allegations by former teachers
        On March 21 2023, several prominent and established teachers at the ed-tech company alleged that their vision of the company is being disillusioned and in response started an independent YouTube channel by the name, 'Sankalp'.[9] They said that their resignation at PW was because of the atmosphere at the company and that at the Kota centre of PW, students were not getting the quality education worth their tuition fee.[10]

        In response, a teacher of the company, Pankaj Sijairya, alleged in a video that the three ex-PW teachers – Tarun Kumar, Manish Dubey, and Sarvesh Dixit were offered INR 5 Cr each to resign from Physics Wallah and join the rival company, Adda247.[11] The three teachers, in a video claimed that Pankaj Sijairya falsely accused them of accepting bribes from rival platform Adda247.[12]
        
        The company, in a statement to Business Today has addressed the controversy and called it a “distraction.”[13]
