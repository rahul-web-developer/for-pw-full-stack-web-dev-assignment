    <!--Write a short note on tags, elements, and attributes along with relevant examples-->

    <p>Tags, elements, and attributes are fundamental components of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and XML (eXtensible Markup Language), which are used to structure and describe the content of web pages and other documents. Here's a brief explanation of each:

    Tags: Tags are the building blocks of HTML and XML documents. They define the structure and organization of the content within the document. Tags are enclosed in angle brackets (< and >) and are usually written in lowercase. They are used to mark the beginning and end of elements. For example, the <p> tag represents a paragraph element.

    Elements: Elements are created using tags and represent different types of content within a document. They can include text, images, links, tables, forms, and more. Each element has a specific purpose and may contain other elements nested within them. Elements are defined by their opening and closing tags, which enclose the content they represent. For instance, the <h1> element is used to define a heading, while the <img> element represents an image.

    Attributes: Attributes provide additional information about an element. They are used within the opening tag of an element and consist of a name-value pair. The attribute name is written before the equal sign (=), and its value is enclosed in quotation marks. Attributes can modify the behavior, appearance, or other characteristics of an element. For example, the href attribute in an <a> tag specifies the URL that the link should point to, while the src attribute in an <img> tag indicates the image source.

Tags, elements, and attributes work together to structure and describe the content within HTML and XML documents. They enable web browsers and other software to interpret and display the information correctly, allowing for the creation of interactive and dynamic web pages.
