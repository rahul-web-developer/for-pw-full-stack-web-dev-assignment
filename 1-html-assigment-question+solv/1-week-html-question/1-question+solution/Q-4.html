    <!-- List out any 3 tags we learned in this module and give a brief explanation about the tags>-->

    <h1></h1>: The <h1> tag is used to define the main heading of a webpage. It represents the highest level of heading and is typically displayed in a larger and more prominent font compared to other headings. You can use <h2> through <h6> tags for lower-level headings.

        <p></p>: The <p> tag is used to define a paragraph of text. It is commonly used for normal text content on a webpage. When you enclose a block of text within the <p> and </p> tags, it helps browsers and search engines understand that the content is a paragraph and should be displayed accordingly.
    
        <a></a>: The <a> tag is used to create hyperlinks or anchor links on a webpage. By specifying the URL within the "href" attribute of the <a> tag, you can link to another webpage or a specific location within the same page. The text between the opening and closing <a> tags is displayed as the clickable link.
    
    These are just a few basic HTML tags, but they are fundamental for creating well-structured web content. Let me know if you have any further questions or if you were referring to a specific module!
