    <br>
    <p>Global attributes are characteristics or properties that are applicable to an entire HTML document. They can be used in various HTML elements to provide additional information or define behavior across the entire document. Here are five commonly used global attributes:

        class: Specifies one or more CSS classes to be applied to an element. It is often used for styling purposes or selecting elements with JavaScript or CSS.
    
        id: Assigns a unique identifier to an element. It is typically used to target specific elements for styling, scripting, or linking purposes.
    
        style: Allows inline CSS styling to be applied directly to an element. It can be used to set various visual properties such as color, font, size, etc.
    
        title: Provides additional information or a tooltip text about an element when the user hovers over it. It is primarily used for accessibility and enhancing user experience.
    
        lang: Specifies the language of the content within an element. It helps screen readers and search engines understand the language used and can assist in proper rendering and interpretation of the content.
    
    These global attributes can be used in combination with specific element attributes to further enhance the functionality and appearance of HTML elements.
