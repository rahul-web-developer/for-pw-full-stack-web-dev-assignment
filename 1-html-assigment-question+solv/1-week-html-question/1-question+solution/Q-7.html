    <!-- Explain in brief about the nesting operators in emmet-->
  <p> Child Operator (>): The child operator represents a direct child element. It is used to indicate that one element is a direct child of another element. For example, div>ul>li will generate a <div> element containing a <ul> element, which in turn contains an <li> element.

        Sibling Operator (+): The sibling operator creates elements that are siblings of each other. It is used to indicate that one element immediately follows another element. For example, h1+p will generate an <h1> element followed by a <p> element.
    
        Climb-up Operator (^): The climb-up operator allows you to move up the hierarchy of elements. It is useful when you want to refer to a parent element. For example, div>ul>li^a will generate a <div> element containing a <ul> element, which in turn contains an <li> element followed by an <a> element that is a sibling of the <ul> element.
    
        Multiplication Operator (*): The multiplication operator is used to duplicate elements. It allows you to specify the number of times an element should be repeated. For example, ul>li*3 will generate a <ul> element containing three <li> elements.
    
        Grouping Operator (()): The grouping operator is used to group elements together. It allows you to create complex structures by nesting elements within a group. For example, div>(header>ul>li*2)+footer>p will generate a <div> element containing a nested structure with a <header> element, <ul> element with two <li> elements, and a sibling <footer> element followed by a <p> element.
    
    These nesting operators in Emmet make it easier to generate structured code quickly and efficiently by representing complex hierarchies in a compact syntax.
