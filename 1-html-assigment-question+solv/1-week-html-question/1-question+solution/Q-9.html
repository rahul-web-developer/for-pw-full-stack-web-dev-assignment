    <!--What are self-closing tags? Write a brief note on meta tags-->
    <br>
    <p>Self-closing tags, also known as empty tags or void elements, are HTML or XML tags that do not require a closing tag. Instead, they have a forward slash at the end of the opening tag to indicate that it should be self-closed.

        In HTML, self-closing tags are used for elements that do not have any content or do not need a closing tag for other reasons. These tags are typically used for elements such as line breaks, images, inputs, meta tags, and others. For example:
        
        html
        
        <br /> <!-- Line break -->
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image" /> <!-- Image -->
        <input type="text" name="username" /> <!-- Input field -->
        <meta charset="UTF-8" /> <!-- Meta tag -->
        
        It's important to note that in HTML5, the closing slash is optional for self-closing tags, so you can also write them without the slash:
        
        html
        
        <br> <!-- Line break -->
        <img src="image.jpg" alt="Image"> <!-- Image -->
        <input type="text" name="username"> <!-- Input field -->
        <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- Meta tag -->
        
        However, for compatibility with older browsers and XML, it's generally recommended to include the closing slash in self-closing tags.

        <p>Meta tags are snippets of HTML code that provide information about a webpage to search engines and other web crawlers. They are not visible to website visitors, but they play an essential role in helping search engines understand the content and purpose of a webpage. Meta tags can influence how search engines index and display a webpage in search results.

            There are several types of meta tags, but two of the most commonly used ones are:
            
                Meta Description: The meta description tag provides a brief summary of the webpage's content. It appears in search engine results below the page title and URL. The purpose of the meta description is to entice users to click on the search result by providing a concise and informative description of the page's content.
            
                Meta Keywords: The meta keywords tag used to be popular in the early days of search engine optimization (SEO), but its influence has diminished significantly. It allowed website owners to specify a list of relevant keywords related to their webpage's content. However, due to abuse and spamming, major search engines like Google no longer consider meta keywords when ranking pages.
            
            In addition to these two, there are other meta tags that provide specific information to search engines, such as the meta viewport tag, which helps with responsive web design, and the meta robots tag, which instructs search engine crawlers on how to handle the page.
            
            It's worth noting that while meta tags can provide useful information to search engines, they are not the sole factor determining a webpage's ranking. Search engines utilize complex algorithms that consider various other factors, such as the quality and relevance of the content, backlinks, user experience, and social signals.
            
            Webmasters and SEO professionals should be mindful of using relevant and accurate meta tags to enhance a webpage's visibility and improve its click-through rate from search results. However, it's important to focus on creating high-quality content and optimizing other aspects of a website as well to achieve optimal search engine performance.
